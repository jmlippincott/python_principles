# The aim of this challenge is to write code that can analyze code submissions. We'll simplify things a lot to not make this too hard.
#
# Write a function named validate that takes code represented as a string as its only parameter.
#
# Your function should check a few things:
#
# the code must contain the def keyword
# otherwise return "missing def"
# the code must contain the : symbol
# otherwise return "missing :"
# the code must contain ( and ) for the parameter list
# otherwise return "missing paren"
# the code must not contain ()
# otherwise return "missing param"
# the code must contain four spaces for indentation
# otherwise return "missing indent"
# the code must contain validate
# otherwise return "wrong name"
# the code must contain a return statement
# otherwise return "missing return"
# If all these conditions are satisfied, your code should return True.
#
# Here comes the twist: your solution must return True when validating itself.

def validate(string):
    if "def" not in string:

    elif any([b for b in string if b == ")" if string[string.index(b) - 1] == "("]):

    elif "    " not in string:
        return "missing indent"
    elif "validate" not in string:
        return "wrong name"
